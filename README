Description:
  Accepts arguments for a disk image file and an output directory. The program
  parses the provided disk image and finds all valid files including
  deleted files that have not been overwritten. It prints information about the
  found files and writes those files to the given directory.

KNOWN PROBLEMS
  SegFault when the path to a file found on the disk image is more than
  STRINGBUFFER (50) characters long.
  Program does not check size and does not check FAT for directories.
  Instead, the program stops reading a directory only when the first byte of
  an entry (subdirectory/file) is 0.

DESIGN
  Splitting the different parts of the program into individual functions made it
  a lot easier to understand and modularize my work. I found recursive functions
  to be especially useful in searching directories for files.
